# Token Listings & Partnership Requests

## Permission-less pool creation & swaps

At the heart of Sushi is a permission-less DEX, thus anyone can create pools and swap for tokens through the protocol. If a token is not in the current default list, it can be searched for via the token address.

## So what gives, how can I get my project’s token on the default list?

Though it isn’t requirement for users to swap and supply liquidity in the protocol, our default list makes it easier for users finding tokens. Thus projects that wish to have their token show in the default swap list will need to submit their information via our [partner portal](https://www.sushi.com/partner).

Sushi generally approves most tokens that submit a request through the partner portal that have liquidity & swap volume. Also being listed on coin gecko will improve chances, and speed of listing in most cases.

Keep in ming, filling out your token’s details through the partner portal doesn’t guarantee being added to the default list and asking for your token to be added through Discord or other means won’t increase your chances of being added.

## Onsen Listing / Sushi Earn

Sushi utilizes the Onsen program through our [earn app](https://www.sushi.com/earn) to incentivize liquidity providers with SUSHI token rewards on selected pairs. Projects can also setup incentives in their own token to reward liquidity providers.

We reserve SUSHI tokens for select pairs based on volume and tvl metrics. Decided on a case by case basis.

Projects wanting to incentivize liquidity pairs with their own token’s can do so by working with us to get it setup. For this, we do require project’s to have a minimum of $100k TVL, and project’s interested can apply through our [Partnership Request Form](https://rbieu62gj0f.typeform.com/to/KkrPkOFe).
