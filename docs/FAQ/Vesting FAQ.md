# Vesting FAQ

**_As of March 29, 2021, any new $SUSHI rewards will no longer be subject to a 6 month vesting period and will be harvested weekly_**

### Prior to March 29, 2021, what share of my $SUSHI rewards were vested?

66.6%

### For how long are my $SUSHI rewards vested?

6 months from the moment they are earned. So, if you earn 10 $SUSHI, today you can harvest 1/3 immediately, and the remaining 2/3 after 6 months of waiting. After March 29, 2021, any new $SUSHI rewards are no longer subject to the 6 month vesting.

### Must I stay staked to receive my vested $SUSHI rewards?

You can unstake at any time. Your vested (locked up) yield will still be available to you when their lock-up time is over.

### When can I collect my vested $SUSHI?

They can be harvested 6 months from the time you/your pool earned the rewards.

### Where can I check my vested $SUSHI balance?
