# How to Multichain: Polygon

Sushi had the pleasure of announcing its first non-Ethereum Mainnet yield farms on the Polygon network in early May, 2021.

The following Medium article details how to use Sushi's swap function, participate in yield farms, and perform lending activities on Kashi, all while using the Polygon (formerly Matic) network:

### LP Rewards on Polygon

After an initial experimental budget for 3 months, rewards for incentivized Liquidity Provision as well as Kashi Lending will run indefinitely.

### MATIC Faucet

If you have moved funds to Polygon network and do not have any MATIC for gas, you will be unable to do any transactions. This is similar to not having any ETH on the Ethereum network to pay for gas to cover your transaction costs. Please try the following links to MATIC Faucets, where they will send you a small amount of MATIC to get you going.
