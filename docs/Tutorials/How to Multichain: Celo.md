# How to Multichain: Celo

## Sushi on Celo

To start earning rewards, you’ll need to access a wallet, add $CELO, and connect to the Celo chain using the Sushi app.

**Note:** _Celo only supports MetaMask, CeloWallet.app, and CeloTerminal to start (via Wallet Connect v2). Valora is not supported. This tutorial will focus on getting you started with MetaMask, but you may use any supported wallet you prefer._

### Connect Your MetaMask to Celo

**Step 1.** Navigate to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) and download a wallet.

**Step 3.** Select _Networks_ and choose _Custom RPC_ to add Celo.

**Step 4.** Follow [these steps](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC) to add the Celo network to your MetaMask wallet.

### How to use the Celo Chain on Sushi with MetaMask

When using Sushi on the Celo Network, it will look and feel like your regular Sushi interface, with some slight changes. For starters, fees can be paid in ERC20 tokens, and not just the native token of the protocol, $CELO. For instance, transacting with cUSD, fees can be paid in cUSD as well.

**Swap Tokens**

**Step 1.** Go to [https://app.sushi.com/swap](https://app.sushi.com/swap)

**Step 2.** Switch your network to Celo.

**Step 3.** Select the token you wish to swap _from_ and _to_.

<img src='/img/tutimg/htmc/htmc7.jpeg' alt="" width="75%" />

**Step 4.** Input the amount you wish to swap or click _MAX_.

**Step 5.** Click _Approve_

**Note:** _Your swap may not proceed if the price impact is too high. If this is the case, please lower the number of tokens you are trying to swap._

**Step 6.** Allow Sushi to spend your tokens by confirming in your wallet.

**Step 7.** After this approval process, click _Swap_.

**Step 8.** Confirm the swap transaction fee from your wallet and voila! All done.

### Liquidity & Yield Farming

You can also earn $SUSHI rewards using the Celo-hosted Onsen. To participate in the Onsen program, you need to provide liquidity to the Sushi exchange with your held assets. For doing this, Sushi’s revenue-sharing program rewards its liquidity providers with 0.25% of the 0.30% fee that is charged for every swap on the platform.

The Onsen program also takes this a step further and adds more liquidity providing incentives by allotting participants with $SUSHI token rewards. Let’s go through the steps together to step into Sushi’s Onsen on the Celo network.

**Step 1.** Go to [app.sushi.com](https://app.sushi.com/)

**Step 2.** Switch your network to Celo

**Step 3.** Click the _Farm_ tab to check which farms are available on the Celo network that you would like to join.

**Note:** _In order for you to join an Onsen pair and start earning rewards, you need to add liquidity first, which we will outline next._

**Step 4.** Click the _Pool_ tab.

**Step 5.** Select the tokens you wish to add liquidity to (must be a valid token pair!)

**Note:** _When adding liquidity to a pair, both sides of the pair need to have an exact monetary value._

**Step 6.** Add the amount of tokens you wish to add to the pool of the first token. Our platform will automatically calculate the equal monetary value of liquidity to the second asset, given there is sufficient balance.

**Step 7.** Approve Sushi to access your tokens from your wallet.

**Step 8.** Click _Supply_, then _Confirm Supply_ in the popup.

**Step 9.** Approve the transaction and relevant fees from your wallet and you will now receive your liquidity pair or LP tokens!

**Step 10.** Once the transaction approves, click the _Yield_ tab and click the yield farming pair you wish to join. You should see your Wallet Balance now display your received LP tokens.

**Step 11.** Input the amount of LP tokens you wish to add to the farm or click MAX.

**Step 12.** Click _Approve_

**Step 13.** Allow Sushi to spend your SLP tokens from your wallet.

**Step 14.** Click _Deposit_

**Step 15.** Confirm the transaction and the relevant fees from your wallet.

Once the transaction completes, you will now be a $SUSHI farmer on the Celo network! When you refresh the _Yield_ tab on [app.sushi.com](https://app.sushi.com/), you will see your assets farming away 24/7 under the subheading: _Your Yields_.

### Harvest

Click _Harvest_ whenever you want to withdraw your $SUSHI to your wallet.

**Step 5.** Confirm the transaction and their relevant fees from your wallet.

**Step 6:** On the same page, click _Remove Liquidity_ and select the percentage you wish to remove. Slide the cursor to MAX to remove it entirely. Once selected, click _Approve_.

**Step 7.** To remove, you need to sign the SLP token agreement from your wallet. Click _Sign_ from your wallet.

**Step 8.** After the signing processes, click _Remove_, then _Confirm_ in the popup.

**Step 9.** Confirm the transaction and their relevant fees from your wallet.

**Step 10.** Click _Pool_ and you should see your liquidity position under the tab _Your Liquidity._ If you cannot see it, please give it some time to load or refresh the page.

**Step 11.** On the liquidity pair you wish to withdraw click _Manage_, then _Remove._
