# Overview

SushiXSwap is one of the first ever cross-chain AMMs (Automated Market Makers), enabling our users to execute token swaps across chains without any hassle, lockup period or extra fees. It leverages LayerZero's Stargate protocol to quickly and effectively move your assets to where they need to go. Quick, permissionless and safe cross-chain swaps for all!

The secret to the ease and convenience of SushiXSwap is how it sources liquidity; in a standard cross-chain swap, attempting to locate deep enough liquidity on both sides of a trade was the biggest pain point. It stifled trade and made for a shoddy user experience, something the industry as a whole is working to combat against currently. SushiXSwap, however, uses _our own liquidity pools_ on _each chain_ in the cross-chain transaction, enabling users to always receive the best price for any pair. Additionally, SushiXSwap gets all of this done in a matter of _minutes_, not hours or days. It plays well with others too, supporting _all_ of the following:

-   Trident
-   BentoBox
-   Wallet
-   Legacy AMM

SushiXSwap was integrated directly into our well known frontend, a friction-less process that now simply adds the power of cross-chain swaps on top of it, while changing nothing else about the underlying contracts or infrastructure. Users can still interact with the Sushi UI that they know and love, and still on any chain that we're deployed to. Remember to keep a close eye on our socials, as we'll be continuing to deploy SushiXSwap to more and more chains. Currently, the following chains are fully supported for cross-chain swaps:

-   Ethereum (Mainnet)
-   Arbitrum One
-   Avalanche (C-Chain)
-   Binance Smart Chain
-   Fantom Opera
-   Optimism
-   Polygon

...with more soon to come!
