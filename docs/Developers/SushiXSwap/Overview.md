# Overview

SushiXSwap is one of the first ever cross-chain AMMs (Automated Market Makers), enabling our users to execute token swaps across chains without any hassle, lockup period or extra fees. It leverages LayerZero's Stargate protocol to quickly and effectively move your assets to where they need to go.

The secret to the ease and convenience of SushiXSwap is in how it sources liquidity; in a traditional cross-chain swap, attempting to locate deep enough liquidity on both sides of a trade was the biggest pain point. It stifled trade and made for a shoddy user experience. SushiXSwap, however, uses _our own liquidity pools_ on _each chain_ in the cross-chain transaction, enabling users to always receive the best price for any pair. Additionally, SushiXSwap gets all of this done in a matter of _minutes_, not hours or days. It plays well with others too, supporting _all_ of the following:

-   Trident
-   BentoBox
-   Wallet
-   Legacy AMM

Sushi’s swap routing finds the cheapest, fastest and most secure route for any user to get from point A to point B by plugging into Layer0’s Stargate bridge infrastructure. Stargate bridges chains securely without compromising on decentralization, which allows SushiXSwap to scale to any number of chains in the future. To further ensure we can always find the cheapest route and best price between any two tokens on all chains, we will continue to aggregate more bridges in the future. By building SushiXSwap in a modular, composable way, we will simplify the integration of your favorite bridge into our aggregator interface.

SushiXSwap features everything you already love about Sushi - but across multiple chains:

-   **Deepest liquidity:** Always finds a path to trade on all major chains
-   **Decentralized:** Built on Stargate
-   **No extra fees:** 0.3% standard DEX fee
-   **Lowest slippage:** No reliance on third parties
-   **Non-custodial:** Protocol-managed liquidity
-   **Fast:** Instantly initiate trades on both chains
-   **Safety guard:** Failed transactions save into stablecoins
-   **Bridge aggregator:** Modular bridge API

SushiXSwap was integrated directly into our UI, simply adding the power of cross-chain swaps on top of it, while changing nothing else about the underlying contracts or infrastructure. Remember to keep a close eye on our socials, as we'll be continuing to deploy SushiXSwap to more and more chains. Currently, the following chains are fully supported for cross-chain swaps:

-   Ethereum (Mainnet)
-   Arbitrum One
-   Avalanche (C-Chain)
-   Binance Smart Chain
-   Fantom Opera
-   Optimism
-   Polygon

...with more soon to come!
